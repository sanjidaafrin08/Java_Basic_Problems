This repository aims to demonstrate problem-solving abilities in Java.It contains solutions to common Java programming problems, focusing on fundamental concepts like searching, sorting, array manipulation, and string operations. It also includes programs that address various computational challenges using different algorithms like linear search, binary search, and pattern generation. 
Features:
1.Find 2nd Highest CGPA:
This program finds the second highest CGPA from a given array of scores using a linear search algorithm, avoiding sorting.
2.Sorting CGPA:
Implements selection sort to arrange CGPA scores in descending order without using any built-in sorting methods.
3.Binary Search for CGPA:
Accepts user input for a CGPA and uses the binary search algorithm to determine if it exists in a sorted array.
4.Random Numbers Max & Min:
Generates an array of 10 random integers and identifies the maximum and minimum values from the array.
5.Note Counter:
Breaks down any given monetary amount into the smallest possible number of notes from a set of predefined denominations.
6.Number Pattern Printing:
Displays a specific pattern of numbers, both ascending and descending, to demonstrate loop-based pattern generation.
7.Find Two Lowest Heights:
Takes the heights of 10 babies as input and identifies the two shortest.
8.String Analysis:
Analyzes a string to count words, characters (excluding spaces), vowels, and consonants.
9.Character Occurrence in String:
Calculates the number of occurrences of each character in a given string.
10.Find Unique Numbers:
Identifies and prints all unique (non-duplicate) numbers from an array.
11.Remove Vowels from a String:
Removes all vowels from the input string and displays the result.
12.Calculate Total Cost After Discount:
Extracts prices from a text and applies a 15% discount to calculate the total cost.
